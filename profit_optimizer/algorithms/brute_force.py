class BruteForce:

    """
    Brute Force algorithm for the knapsack problem that explores all possible combinations
    of actions to find the optimal solution.

    Time Complexity: O((L+1)^n) where:
        - n = number of actions
        - L = purchase_limit
        - For each action, we have (L+1) choices: buy 0, 1, 2, ..., L quantities
        - This results in (L+1)^n total combinations to explore
        - When L=1 (typical case), this simplifies to O(2^n),
        2 is the number of choices we have for each action: buy it or not

    Space Complexity: O(n) where:
        - n = number of actions (maximum recursion depth)
        - Additional O(k) for storing the best combination, where k â‰¤ n*L (because of contraint: the budget)
        - The current_combination list grows and shrinks during backtracking
        - Overall space is dominated by recursion stack: O(n)

    Note: This algorithm guarantees finding the optimal solution but becomes
    impractical for large datasets due to exponential time complexity.
